This starter has been forked and upgraded to Gatsby v2.

This is a Gatsby v2 fork of [gatsby-starter-casper](https://github.com/haysclark/gatsby-starter-casper) by [@haysclark](https://github.com/haysclark). The upgrade to v2 was mostly done by [@hnspn](https://github.com/hnspn) with a little help from the folks at [GatsbyCentral](https://www.gatsbycentral.com/).

Here's a little recommended reading for Gatsby v2.
