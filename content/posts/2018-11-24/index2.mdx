Hi again!

Just a heads up that we now have a new paste service at [https://paste.fiery.me](https://paste.fiery.me), which is using [PrivateBin](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/).

Previously that domain used to host a [hastebin](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) server, but I figured it was about time to change it since I've been meaning to do so for quite a while already.

I've configured the paste's max size to 30MB, so enjoy.
