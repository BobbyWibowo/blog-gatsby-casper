In short, the domain now uses wildcard subdomain, which means you can use ANY subdomain you like!

Just keep in mind these rules:

- `will.always.want.me` redirects to `safe.fiery.me`
- `*will-always-want.me/*` redirects to `i.fiery.me/*`

For the first rule, notice the lack of wildcard symbols?

Yes, that means `will-always-want.me/abc.jpg` actually redirects to `i.fiery.me/abc.jpg` instead!

The only thing that redirects to `safe.fiery.me` is `will-always-want.me` with neither subdomain nor paths!

If at this point you still don't know what this domain is all about, check out these previous articles:

- [Extra domains for the safe](/extra-domain-for-the-safe)
- [*.will-always-want.me is actually still active](/will-always-want-me-is-actually-still-active)

That's all! See ya folks!
