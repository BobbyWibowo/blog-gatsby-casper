In short, the domain now uses wildcard subdomain, which means you can use ANY subdomain you like!

Just keep in mind these rules:

- `will.always.want.me` redirects to `safe.fiery.me`
- `*will-always-want.me/**/*` redirects to `i.fiery.me/$3` 
- `*will-always-want.me/*` redirects to `i.fiery.me/$2`

For the first rule, notice the lack of wildcard symbols?

Yes, that means `will-always-want.me/abc.jpg` actually redirects to `i.fiery.me/abc.jpg` instead!

For the second rule, the double asterisks mean they accept any amount of sub-directories in between.

Take the following examples:

- `subdomain.will-always-want.me/dir1/dir2/dir3/abc.jpg`
- `subdomain.will-always-want.me/dir1/abc.jpg`

Both of those actually redirect to `i.fiery.me/abc.jpg`!

As for the third rule, that is the very basic `subdomain.will-always-want.me/abc.jpg` redirecting to `i.fiery.me/abc.jpg`.

In conclusion, the only thing that redirects to `safe.fiery.me` instead is `will-always-want.me` that has neither subdomain nor paths

If at this point you still don't know what this domain is all about, check out these previous articles:

That's all! See ya folks!
