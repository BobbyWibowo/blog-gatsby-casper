If you don't know which safe I'm talking about, it's the one at [safe.fiery.me](https://safe.fiery.me/).

Less than 24 hours ago it has officially started using 4 letters for file name as opposed to the old 32 letters. That's a lot of reduction!

Other than some other custom fixes, it's also now up-to-date with [WeebDev/lolisafe](https://github.com/WeebDev/lolisafe). And yeah, you can still check whatever changes I've added in the fork [BobbyWibowo/lolisafe](https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/lolisafe).

That's all~
