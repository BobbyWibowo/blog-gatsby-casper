Hey there folks, I have to bring a bad news this time..

As the title says, I've reduced max file size to 25 MB,... for the time being at least.

In the past few months the server have been rapidly running out of disk space. I could usually manage by purging cartoons and the likes from the server, but the occasion in which I had to do that had been getting more and more often lately..

Initially I was planning on implementing a global dynamic file retention algorithm thing, like the one used in [0x0.st](https://0x0.st), but I've been too busy with real life stuff that I simply couldn't spare the time (it has been on [my to-do list](https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/lolisafe/projects/1#card-39047761) for quite a long while by now).

So for the time being I'll just reduce max file size to especially deter those people that simply will never stop uploading cartoons into the server. I've been banning IPs now and then, but there were simply too many of them..

Sorry.
