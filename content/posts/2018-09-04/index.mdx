Hi guys,

Just a heads up. Recently, it has come to my attention that the safe was being blacklisted by browsers due to malicious uploaded files.

So I've scanned all existing files and removed some infected uploads. I've also implemented virus scanning to the upload process using ClamAV, so hopefully it won't be getting as much malicious uploads in the future. I've also submitted an appeal to Google, so hopefully the safe will no longer be blacklisted soon.
