Hi,

So yeah, as the title says, this blog ([blog.fiery.me](https://blog.fiery.me)) is now hosted at GitHub Pages. So whenever anything happens to the actual physical server where I host both [safe.fiery.me](https://safe.fiery.me) and [paste.fiery.me](https://paste.fiery.me), this blog will stay online. That way I can then post following news about whatever happens to the server here.

Well, that's all. See ya!
