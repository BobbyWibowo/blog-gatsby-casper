Hey there,

Just a quick announcement that I've raised min/default file identifier length to 5 chars.

I've noticed the safe logging out collisions a lot recently, so I guess it's about time. For the curious, we are currently serving over 85k uploads.

Other than that, if anybody had noticed before, sometimes uploads would stop without any error messages when trying to upload big files (could usually be solved by lowering chunk size).

Apparently it was caused by a built-in timeout setting of the uploader script..

Anyway, starting with commit [ec7c160](https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/lolisafe/commit/ec7c160f31cefd321f4de67d5ce6eb4901a1e628), you should be able to upload big files just fine.

That's all for today. I'll be seeing y'all next time!
