Hi there,

Not sure if anybody is even still using paste.fiery.me, but I'm posting this anyway to inform that it is now shut down too.

Honestly, I'm actually planning to just replace it with a very basic hastebin installation (although heard they were recently acquired by Toptal or something? so I may have to research on that a bit more), since it's quite a pain to update the PrivateBin installation that I had been using for paste.fiery.me.

To begin with, I wasn't particularly concerned with the whole encryption feature. Heck, safe.fiery.me was never one about that philosophy either.

But yeah, that's something for the future, cause I don't have much time these days (and I actually prefer using GitHub Gist anyways). Thus meanwhile, it'll be temporarily shut down.
