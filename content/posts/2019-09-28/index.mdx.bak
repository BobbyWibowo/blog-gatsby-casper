Hi there!

Just a quick announcement that we now have early support for HTTP/3 in `*.fiery.me` due to Cloudflare (excluding `blog.fiery.me` which is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) instead).

If you're curious of what that is, check out Cloudflare's blog post here: [HTTP/3: the past, the present, and the future](https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/).

I joined the waiting list a while back when I received an email announcement about it, and apparently I received another email just a couple hours ago, mentioning that `fiery.me` is included in the early invitees.

So that's nice, I guess?

Anyway, that's all for now. See ya!
