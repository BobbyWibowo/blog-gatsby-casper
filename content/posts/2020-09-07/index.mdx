Hey there, just a quick notice that `*.will-always-want.me` domain will shutdown in 25 September 2020.

Check out the following article if you had no idea this domain existed: [Update about *.will-always-want.me](https://blog.fiery.me/update-about-will-always-want-me).

As a replacement, I've rented a new domain name named `lolis.cyou`, as the cost is much cheaper than a dot ME domain (I feel it painful enough to continue renting fiery.me).

Same redirect rules as the previous domain, which are the following with the new domain:

- `lolis.cyou` redirects to `safe.fiery.me`
- `*.lolis.cyou/**/*` redirects to `i.fiery.me/$3` 
- `*.lolis.cyou/*` redirects to `i.fiery.me/$2`

I'm thinking of something like `dont-let-the.lolis.cyou/with-your-pants-off/abcde.png`..

Yeah, I can't think of anything better. But you can do whatever you want really, so go wild.

Additional note about wildcard subdomain: It only allows 1-level wildcard. Meaning something like `sub-a.sub-b.lolis.cyou` is not possible. It's mostly a limitation with the SSL certificate not allowing multi-level wildcards. Otherwise they work just fine with HTTP.
