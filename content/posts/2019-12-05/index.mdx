Hi there, yet another quick announcement that we now have logs of taken down uploads which can be found here: [https://safe.fiery.me/takedowns](https://safe.fiery.me/takedowns).

As already stated in there, I will be updating the file within 48 hours after I have personally taken down some uploads for any reasons (e.g. Google Safe Search warnings, DMCA takedown notices, personal decisions).

*Personal decisions* will include full-length anime seasons that I will eventually delete as mentioned in [this previous blog post](/warning-stop-uploading-full-length-anime-episodes-to-the-safe).

That's all. See ya!
