**TL;DR.** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

---

*Edited on 28/04/2020.*

Hey there folks, another announcement here.

In recent months, I've starting seeing sudden spikes in the safe's disk usage. When I investigated further, I then noticed a few accounts with **very high disk usages**, as compared to other accounts in the safe.

This got me curious, and also worried, cause I never claimed that the safe had unlimited disk storage.

After investigating said accounts, I then noticed that they were only being used to upload full-length anime episodes. There were a lot who uploaded **entire seasons** of random anime to boot, and yes, all of their episodes were also full-length.

I was sure it'd only be a matter of time before I got DMCA requests for these uploads. (Yes, I do respond to DMCA requests.)

In fact, before this I actually already got them a few times, with one even requesting to take down over 50 different files, which all happened to be full-length anime episodes as well. ~~(On a side note, I'm planning to log all these DMCA requests in a text file, which everyone can access, someday in the future.)~~ ([already implemented](/takedown-logs)).

For now, I won't be touching these uploads until I get DMCA requests for them.

But to those who own those accounts, be warned that **I will eventually delete their uploads in the future**, regardless of whether I will get DMCA requests or not. Your accounts will also be banned, and don't even bother contacting me about it as I won't bother responding either.

Not only would I be troubled by DMCA requests, if any, the safe's disk storage is also limited, and I'd very much prefer to prioritize the rest of us, who primarily used the safe for good ol' small files sharing (screenshots and all that jazz).

I mean, I'm **not** entirely against uploading huge files, that's why I even bothered to [raise the file size](/file-size-chunked-uploads-and-stuff) to the maximum allowed by Cloudflare, which was 512 MB, but I was mostly expecting people to only upload such huge files every once in a while.

I'm pretty sure these full-length anime episodes were **very likely** uploaded to my safe for the sole reason of using them on their *anime streaming websites* or whatever other nonsense.

Geez, get a proper video streaming service for those. Seriously.

I mean sure, the safe is hosted in France, which is supposedly "offshore", but I personally **will** still respond to DMCA requests. ~~Cloudflare can still *frick* me over if someone choose to talk directly with that big guy.~~ ([They already fricked me over](/breaking-news), though due to massive bandwidth usage instead).

So yeah, that's all from me for today. I guess I'll be seeing y'all in the next blog post. ðŸ‘‹
