Huhu.. So yeah, I've just changed the blog's software again..

Back then I switched from Wordpress to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), but now I've switched from Hexo to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

To be honest, there isn't really much reasonings behind my decision this time.

At first, I kinda wanted to change my Hexo theme, but I couldn't really find a good one. So I came to the conclusion that the software wasn't good enough. Cause good software = more users = more theme makers, lul.

So yeah, I thought of looking for another software/framework/whatever, and I stumbled upon Gatsby.

I sorta just liked how... fancy it was. Right, fancy.

So, cause I liked fancy things, I figured I should see if there's any good themes, and I found [one](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-casper).

So yeah, I was like, "let's roll with this!", then here we are.

Don't ask me why I didn't just make my own theme. I was never good at web design, or just any designs in general.. Plus, that sounds exhausting as heck..
