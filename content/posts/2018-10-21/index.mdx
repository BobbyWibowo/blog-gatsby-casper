Hi there,

Another update to the safe. HTM/HTML files are now allowed again. But unlike before where they were served as `text/html`, now they will be served as `text/plain`. This should solve phising attempts while still allowing people to use the safe to store HTM/HTML files.

That's all. See ya.
