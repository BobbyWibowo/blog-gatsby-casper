Hi there,

For those who hadn't noticed what I commented on the previous [article about rate limits](/rate-limits), here it is:

> Removed this rate limit, in favor of active monitoring of traffic to automatically temp-ban IPs that crosses certain uncommon thresholds.  
> This method should no longer interfere with regular users, but may or may not start temp-banning bots and/or scanners.  
> I may consider lowering the thresholds if server still can't manage during peak hours.  
> Source: http://disq.us/p/28djfvb

So well, I didn't mention the thresholds awhile back, so here they are in no particular order:

- Max. 32 concurrent connnections to `i.fiery.me/*`.
- No concurrent connection limits to `i.fiery.me/thumbs/*`.
- Temp-ban IP for 60 mins if it has surpassed the concurrent connection limits 30 times in a day.  
This counts all subsequent connections after the 32nd connection if all were done at once (i.e. making 62 concurrent connections will immediately result in a temp-ban, because those are already 30 over the 32 limit).

The following also applies to the whole `*.fiery.me` network:

- Temp-ban IP for 24 hours if it has tried accessing missing files (404) 50 times in a day.  
This is mainly aimed at scanners. Don't waste your time fellas.
- Temp-ban IP for 24 hours if it has caused [nginx to say "no"](https://httpstatusdogs.com/444-no-response) 5 times in a day.  
So tread carefully fellas..
- *There are also a few other security-related thresholds, but you won't have to deal with any of those as long as you remain a good person.*

I may reconsider these thresholds on the future.

That's all. See ya fellas.
