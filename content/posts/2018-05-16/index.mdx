Hello there,

Some of you guys may have noticed that the safe has changed the domain used to serve files uploaded to it at least 3 times by now. Yeah, at first it was using *s.fiery.me*, then afterwards it used *the.fiery.me*, and now it uses *i.fiery.me*.

Yeah well.. back then I was like, "hey, this sounds good" and changed it.. twice, which leaves us with *i.fiery.me* now.

For old users, you'll probably notice that all old links that were using *s.fiery.me* and *the.fiery.me* would still work, and that's because I made both domain redirect to *s.fiery.me*. If you visit any of the old domains and see your address bar, you'll notice that you've been redirected.

So yeah, I have no plan on deleting both *s.fiery.me* and *the.fiery.me*, ever, so old and new users alike may feel free to use any of the aformentioned two domains or the current *i.fiery.me*.

That's all. See ya folks!
