tl;dr. Things end. And this time, it's safe.fiery.me's turn.

You'll have the next 14 days or so to make backups of all of your files. In the meantime you will no longer be able to upload new files. Afterwards all your files will be purged with no additional notices.

Frankly I have nothing much to say.

I simply feel like it's time for me to move on from lolisafe project and to start looking into other things. 

It was fun while it lasted, and sorry for having to do this.

If you're looking for other lolisafe-based file hosts, consider checking out upstream's [sites.md](https://github.com/WeebDev/chibisafe/blob/master/docs/sites.md).
