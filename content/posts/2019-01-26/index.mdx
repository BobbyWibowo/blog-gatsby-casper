*Update 28/04/2020: I haven't been playing this game for months. Though if you still want to add me, feel free. I may pop up again in the future?*

Hello guys!

First post in 2019!

No, this is not a sponsored blog post, kek.

Anyways! I've been playing Azur Lane (EN) for a couple months by now, and so I feel like looking for some more friends, or something like that. So yeah, I decided to make this post.

If any of you guys play in Avrora server, and feel like adding me or anything, please feel free to do so! My username is `BobbyWibowo`.

Kisaragi best waifu!

That's it, I didn't really have anything specific in mind to talk about, so see ya!
