Hello there,

Just a quick notice. Within the next few days I'll be transferring the server to a new location in Paris, France. As some of you may know, our server is currently located in Singapore. The 1-year plan of this current server will be ending more or less in 3 weeks, and I've also been planning on getting a server with much bigger storage, so I decided that it's time to move instead of renewing the current server's plan.

During the moving, `safe.fiery.me` and `paste.fiery.me` will go down. However, `fiery.me`, `blog.fiery.me` (this blog), and especially `i.fiery.me` (the domain serving uploaded files) will remain active.

I can't really specify an ETA as this will be the first time I'm moving an entire server to another. I still haven't tested how fast the connection is from the current server to the new server either. It may take a couple hours, or it may even take a whole day or more.  
So yeah, be prepared.

However, you all can be rest assured that it will come back. ✌️

I'll be posting any updates in the comment section (we're using Disqus - in case someone blocks that and so haven't noticed).
