Long story short, Cloudflare banned fiery.me. Reason being, as it turns out, heavily caching non-HTML files (namely music and videos) with Cloudflare is against their Terms of Service.

To be specific, it's probably only against their Terms of Service after we have used at least as much as fiery.me did in the past 30 days.

I previously [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BobbyWibowoB/status/1226627095276613632?s=20) about it, but basically we have used +23TB of bandwidth (out of +4.4M requests) in the past 30 days.

At the moment, I'm still trying to migrate to another DNS server.

I'll then also have to look into Let's Encrypt and what not, cause I don't actually have my own SSL certificates for fiery.me.

So yeah.

I expect this downtime will last till the next 24 to 48 hours.
