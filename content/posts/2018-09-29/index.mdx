Hi guys,

I recently added an extra domain that would redirect to `i.fiery.me`, namely `lolis.will-always-want.me`. So you can instead use that when posting your meme in Discord and stuff.

Actually just using `will-always-want.me` without the `lolis` subdomain would work too, but only because I didn't bother.

Anyways, the current active subdomain is only `lolis`, but I can add more subdomains later in the future. I don't know, maybe like `your-mom.will-always-want.me` or something? Haha.

Do remember that it's only a simple 301 redirect. Meaning, when someone opens the URL in their browser, they'll end up at `i.fiery.me` instead. It works alright in Discord since their thumbnailer follows redirect.

Anyways, that's all. See ya.
