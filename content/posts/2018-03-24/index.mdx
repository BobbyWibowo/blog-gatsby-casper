Hi hi, just another blog post about safe.fiery.me here.

If you already have an account, you can now set your preferred file name length!

When the safe first started, random file names used to be 32 chars long, but I changed it to 4 chars not too long ago.

Then I figured some people would prefer long names instead, so I implemented this option.

At the moment, users can choose from 4 to 32 chars, but 4 chars is still the default.

If you're using the Chrome/Firefox extension or ShareX, make sure you're properly using your token, as the file name length preference is tied to your account.

Someday in the future, I'll probably add support for non-registered users, but eh, someday~

That's all folks, cya!
