# Gatsby v2

NOTE: This is a Gatsby v2 fork of [gatsby-starter-casper](https://github.com/haysclark/gatsby-starter-casper) by [@haysclark](https://github.com/haysclark). The upgrade to v2 was mostly done by [@hnspn](https://github.com/hnspn) with a little help from the folks at [GatsbyCentral](https://www.gatsbycentral.com/).

A blog starter for [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/), utilizing the popular [Casper (v1.4)](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/tree/1.4) theme authored by [Ghost.io](https://ghost.io/).  The project is based on [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) and has a lot on common with the [Gatsby Material Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter), but will evolve separately. In this project the single Casper CSS file has been carefully extracted into individual components with only minor tweaks.

This starter also serves as example for the [Gatsby-Pagination](https://github.com/infinitedescent/gatsby-pagination) library.

## Content

### Posts

Posts are authored using Markdown and include some optional YAML frontmatter data properties.  Each post should have a separate folder for the .md file in addition to any images or other media related to that post.  Posts are stored in a subfolder in the ```/content/``` directory; the target subfolder is set by the _blogPostDir_ property in _SiteConfig.js_.

### Authors

Each post can reference the author of the post, if the author is not set the default author will be used; which is controlled by the _blogAuthorId_ property in _SiteConfig.js_.  All authors, including the default author (aka _blodAuthorId_) must have an author JSON file.  These JSON files MUST be stored in a folder names ```authors```, for Gatsby to parse them correctly.  The location of this ```authors``` folder can be controlled by the _blogAuthorDir_ property in _SiteConfig.js_. It IS possible to have the ```authors``` folder inside the  _blogPostDir_ folder.
